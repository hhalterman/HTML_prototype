<p> Are you in need of a vacation to a quiet island where you have the luxury of spending time on the beach, taking in the nature of the island, fishing, and even enjoying night life? Middle Bass Island is the perfect destination for your next adventure.</p>
<p>The 805-acre island is shaped a bit like the Big Dipper and is one of three Bass Islands located at the center of a group of 23 smaller islands on Ohio’s Lake Erie. Our famous neighbors include Put-In-Bay, Kelley’s Island, and Pelee Island.</p>

<p>This unique island, although small, is home to some historic landmarks, quaint restaurants and beautiful water where you can always get the best catch of perch, walleye, and other fish native to Lake Erie. </p>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>The island was landed upon by French explorer, Robert La Salle, in 1679. The abundance of wildflowers on the island impressed La Salle and his crew so much that they appropriately named it Isle des Fleures, the Island of Flowers. It would retain this name for the next 200 years until it was acquired by a German count in 1856. With the aid of immigrant German workers, the island was used for grape cultivation. This proved to be a very successful undertaking. Old aerial photos of the island show the majority of the island covered with neat rows of grapevines.</p>

<p>By 1875, Middle Bass Island's Golden Eagle Winery was reputed to be the largest wine producer in the United States. It was one of 8 wineries that existed on the Lake Erie Islands and not only serviced the locals, but wine loves world wide.</p>

<p>The Lonz family acquired the business in 1884 and owned and operated it until the death of George Lonz in 1968. During this time, the winery went through a bit of a rough patch due to prohibituion. George cleverly overcame this complication by selling grape juice with instructions on how it should be stored so it would not ferment and become wine, knowing his buyers would do the opposite of the directions so create their own wine. This allowed Lonz to survive the prohibition era with success, unlike other wineries in the area. </p>

<p>Lonz Winery has often been compared with the wineries of the German Rhineland. The old castle-like structure has been visited by countless dignitaries including five American Presidents. The winery is now part of a corporation bearing the Lonz name. Since 1979, the wines have been made by Italian enologist Claudio Salvador.</p>

<p>On July 1, 2000 tragedy struck the Lonz Winery when a terrace collapsed leaving one dead and dozens injured. Follwoing the tragedy, Lonz Winery was purchased by the state of Ohio and Middle Bass Island State Park.</p>

<p>Lonz Winery has since been renovated by the state of Ohio, and was reopened to the public on June 22, 2017. They are not producing or selling wine on site, but it is open for tours and proposals are being accepted by the state to turn it back into a booming business.</p>
